# Power Modulo Operation

## Problem Statement

The RSA algorithm has been demonstrated in class, where its encryption and decryption both 
require the power modulo operation. Given three positive integers m, k and n, the power modulo 
operation calculates m
k modulus n, denoted as r = m
k mod n , where r ∈ℤ and 0 ≤ r < n
m, k, n are all integers between 1 and (2^31)-1.
