# Power Modulo Operation

## Problem Statement

The RSA algorithm has been demonstrated in class, where its encryption and decryption both 
require the power modulo operation. Given three positive integers m, k and n, the power modulo 
operation calculates m
k modulus n, denoted as r = m
k mod n , where r ∈ℤ and 0 ≤ r < n.
Please write a program to implement the power modulo operation. Test inputs begin with a number 
indicating the number of lines below. For each row below, there are three numbers: m, k and n. 
For each line, please output the result r = m
k mod n on a single line.
Sample code is provided in the file A1Q1.py. You need to modify the function power_modulo. m, 
k, n are all integers between 1 and 231
-1.
There will be 6 sets of test cases with 1 mark each, 2 additional marks are awarded if your code is 
implemented using recursion given that your code passes all 6 sets of test cases. The remaining 2 
marks are awarded with the correct justification of the time complexity of your algorithm.
