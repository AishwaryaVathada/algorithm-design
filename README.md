# Algorithm Design & Dynamic Programming Solutions

This repository contains a curated set of algorithm design problems solved as part of academic coursework, competitive preparation, and research experimentation. Each problem focuses on a unique optimization challenge — from recursive structures and greedy logic to dynamic programming and graph theory.

All problems are implemented in Python with a strong focus on:
- Clean and modular code
- Optimized time and space complexity
- Real-world inspired constraints
- Accompanying documentation and test examples

---

## Structure

Each problem has its own subfolder or script with:
- The original **problem statement** (included in README)
- A Python solution
- Time complexity analysis
- Sample test inputs and outputs (where applicable)
